# 🏠 Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, total square footage, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to accurately predict housing prices in Bengaluru using supervised learning algorithms. This is a typical end-to-end machine learning project that includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Model deployment (optional)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data').  
It includes features such as:
- `location`
- `size`
- `total_sqft`
- `bath`
- `balcony`
- `price`
